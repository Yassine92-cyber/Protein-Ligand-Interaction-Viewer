# Sample Data

This folder contains sample molecular structure files for testing the Protein-Ligand Interaction Viewer.

## Files

- **`sample.pdb`**: A small protein structure (10 amino acids) with a ligand binding site
- **`sample.sdf`**: A small ligand molecule that matches the ligand in the PDB file

## Structure Details

### Protein (sample.pdb)
- **Length**: 10 amino acids (ALA, GLY, SER, LYS, ASP, VAL, ILE, LEU, GLU, ARG)
- **Ligand**: Contains a small organic ligand (HETATM entries)
- **Size**: ~83 atoms total

### Ligand (sample.sdf)
- **Type**: Small organic molecule
